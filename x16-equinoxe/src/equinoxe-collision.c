/**
 * @brief Equinoxe main collision detection routine.
 *
 * A spacial grid approach is implemented in the equinoxe gaming engine, to ensure
 * blazing performance during collision detection between all the game objects on the screen.
 *
 * Previously, at each frame, we have executed the during the object logic,
 * the movement calculations and image animations for the screen.
 * As part of this object logic, we have also created a spacial grid, using the collision_insert routines.
 * The grid_ routines uses the routine set ht.h, which is a set of routines to create a has table.
 *
 * This collision_detect detection routine, uses the created spacial grid to efficiently compare the positions of each
 * object relative to each other, and will only compare those objects which have opposite party sides.
 *
 * Each cell in the spacial grid is 64x64 pixels wide in terms of screen dimensions.
 * The dimensions of our screen is 640x480, so there are 10 spacial grid cells on the x axis and 8 spacial grid cells on the y axis.
 * For efficiency reasons to store the spacial grid into memory and to optimize the utilization of the byte architecture of the 6502,
 * we reduced the spacial grid resolution with 2 bits to the right, so we divided by 4 both the x and y coordinates,
 * resulting in the spacial grid dimension to be 160x120. Now the spacial grid has table can
 * be built up using only byte values, not integers. So the x and y coordinate in the spacial grid can now be stored in 4 bits each,
 * where the x coordinate takes the lower nibble of the coordinate byte, and the y coordinate the higher nibble of the coordinate byte.
 *
 * So the spacial grid coordinate system **is stored in a hash table** with the x and y coordinates as the key, which is one byte wide!
 * This results in a very fast calculation algorithm for the 6502, where searching through the has table only requires one byte to be hashed.
 * For further efficiency reasons, the has table implements for duplicate keys a linked list, where the links are stored in a pre-defined
 * array of again only byte sized indexes. Again very efficient for the 6502! the spacial grid uses only absolute addressiing,
 * so pointers are completely avoided, which results in fast processing on the 6502.
 *
 * Because the coordinates in the spacial grid are they in the spacial grid hash table,
 * each object stored in the grid cell will result in a linked list to be built up in the spacial grid hash table!
 * So again very efficient, as now we can take the first element of a spacial grid cell linked list, and iterate through that list to
 * verify each object in that list!
 *
 * The collision detection loops through each cell in the spacial grid. Thus, it will loop horizontally 10 cells and vertically 8 cells.
 * 80 cells in total, however this loop is very efficient as it is only on byte level.
 *
 * During each spacial grid cell evaluation, it performs an outer and an inner loop,
 * where it compares the positions and the properties of the objects in the spacial grid cell against each other
 * using the linked list in the spacial grid hash table.
 *
 * And it does it in a special way, so that no object will be compared twice!
 * The outer loop will loop the complete linked list of the hashed grid cell.
 * The inner loop will only loop from the start position of the outer loop and taking the next element in that list as the start.
 *
 * For example, consider we have in the spacial grid cell the following objects A, B, C, D, E.
 * Then the outer loop will loop from A to E, while the inner loop will take for each element of the outer loop the next starting position.
 * So it will loop as follows:
 *
 *   | LOOP ITERATION | 1       | 2     | 3   | 4 |
 *   | -------------: | :-----: | :---: | :-: | - |
 *   | OUTER LOOP     | A       | B     | C   | D |
 *   | INNER LOOP     | B C D E | C D E | D E | E |
 *
 * This results in the minimal sets of objects to be compared witá¸£ each other, and thus, the most optimizal performance!
 *
 * On top of this comparison the properties of each object are evaluated. Each object as a coalition side,
 * which can be SIDE_FRIENDLY or SIDE_ENEMY. The game setup will only require objects to be compared with different coalitions.
 * So objects of the same coalition are never compared. SIDE_FRIENDLY is never compared with SIDE_FRIENDLY and SIDE_ENEMY is never compared with SIDE_ENEMY.
 *
 * Each object has an AABB or bounding box defined, that contains the dimensions of each object to be taken into account when comparing
 * the bounding box overlap between the objects in the spacial grid cell.
