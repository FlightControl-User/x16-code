/**
 * @brief Calculates the x vector from an angle and speed.
 * 
 * In equinoxe world, an angle is not 360 steps but 64 steps to complete a round circle!
 * Each quadrant is subdivided in 16 steps.
 * The vectors are calculated from a common sin/cos table.
 * The 0Â° vector is on the x axis and the 90Â° vector is on the y axis.
 * Rotation is done counter clockwise.
 * This brings us to the following table:
 * >=	<	dx	dy
 * 0	16	1	1
 * 16	32	-1	1
 * 32	48	1	-1
 * 48	64	-1	-1
 * 
 * The speed dx and dy are calculated taking into account the required speed.
 * @param angle 
 * @param speed 
 * @return signed char
